/*
 * iagree.c - modified in class from the c379 "client.c" to show
 * how we can send useful stuff to a web server with sockets.
 *
 * compile with
 * gcc -o iagree iagree.c
 * or
 * gcc -DDEBUG -o iagree iagree.c
 *
 * In this case what we did was capture the http POST request that
 * is sent to the annoying captive proxy server on the "Guest@UofA"
 * network - the result that we developed in class from client.c
 * is a C program that can be run on the command line or in a shell
 * script that will attempt to send the "yes I agree" request.
 *
 * You could wrap the body of the main funciton in a while loop
 * that repeatedly tries and sleeps, and change the SIGALRM handler
 * to sigsetjmp/siglongjmp to sleep and retry if anything times out.
 *
 * Alternatively, you could simply wrapper this progam in a simple
 * shell script on your machine:
 *
 * #!/bin/sh
 *
 * while :; do
 *      iagree
 *      sleep 5
 * done
 *
 * if you compile the program into iagree and run the above program in
 * a shell script you will then happily be authenticated any time you
 * wander onto Guest@UofA without having to click the annoying button
 *
 * Of course, since this is C code, you could always compile it into
 * your dhcp server, or other system program to fire when it sees
 * certain networks. The posisbilities are endless if you start reading
 * your system code...
 *
 * integrating on your own laptop, or integrating onto your own laptop
 * is left as an exercise to the reader.
