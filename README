server_f.c / server_f.h
A Fork implementation of my simple HTTP/1.1 server
Each time we accept a connection from a client, a new
process is created to handle it.

server_p.c / server_p.h
A Pthread implementation of my simple HTTP/1.1 server
Each time we accept a connection from a client, a new
pthread is dispatched to handle it.

server_s.c / server_s.h
This currently isn't working.
Covered in my questions but conceptually and implementation of
this server was significantly harder that the other two.

It serves one connetion, then the server crashes and fails
