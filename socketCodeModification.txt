Just a little modification.

In the code where you call socket

 sock = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sock < 0) {
        perror ("Server: cannot open master socket");
        exit (1);
    }

Instead of using

if (sock < 0)

it is recommended to use

if (sock == -1)

It is always a good practise to follow the documentation of man page.
